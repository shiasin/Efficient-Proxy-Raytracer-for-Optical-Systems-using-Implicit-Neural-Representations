# Efficient Proxy Raytracer for Optical Systems using Implicit Neural Representations

##Abstract: 
Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems, involving 
sequential surface-by-surface computations which can be computationally 
intensive.
We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages implicit neural representations to 
model optical systems with greater efficiency, eliminating the need for 
surface-by-surface computations in a single pass end-to-end model.
Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted from a given source and their 
corresponding rays after passing through a given optical system in a physically 
accurate manner.
